## Recommendations
* As you can see in the first graph, the highest number of successfule historical theater kickstarters were launched in this month. Therefore, based on historical kickstarter data, it is recommended that the new kickstarter campaign be launched in May.
* Additionally, historical data suggests that an average goal of around $5,000 is ideal for a successful campaign. If your goal is too high, it can result in a failed campaign. Previous failed campaigns had an average goal of $10,000.
